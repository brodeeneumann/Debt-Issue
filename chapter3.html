       <p>
    PSLF is not the first forgiveness or assistance program for public servants. Smaller state, federal, local, and university programs have used loan
    assistance to effectively encourage students to become teachers and public-sector doctors, nurses, and lawyers, often for less pay than in the private
    sector. But the PSLF program is by far the largest experiment of its kind—both in the scope and scale of its forgiveness. With 25 percent of the nation working in “public service” as the program defines it and some 70 percent of graduates leaving college with student debt—now averaging more than $30,000—millions stand to profit from the PSLF program’s cancellation of debt.
</p>
<p>
    For Schenkkan, the promise of forgiveness allows her to pursue her passion and offers an early escape from crushing student debt. “It was a carrot of a way you could actually do this,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    But the program’s virtues get lost in byzantine complexity. In order to qualify for its reward, borrowers have to navigate a series of uncoordinated and often unresponsive Kafkaesque bureaucracies, making the program’s promise of forgiveness appear less like a panacea and more like a question mark.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span class="ledein">The PSLF program was created in 2007</span>, during the twilight years of the Bush Administration, as part of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (CCRAA). Previous piecemeal efforts at forgiveness programs weren’t fulfilling a broad enough goal: to encourage people to choose positions in public service and to help them keep those jobs long-term. Panics over predicted labor shortages in hospitals, public schools, and public defenders’ offices indicated to
    lawmakers that a broader-based program to maintain this critical work was needed. Enter the bipartisan and ambitious CCRAA, widely described at the time as “the single largest investment in higher education since the GI Bill.”
</p>
<p>
    The way it works, in theory, is straightforward:
</p>
<p>
    1. You have to work full time for the government or at a 501(c)(3) or other eligible nonprofit (as specified in detail on the Federal Student Aid website).
</p>
<p>
    2. You have to make 120 qualifying payments on an eligible plan toward a consolidated direct federal loan. The Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan caps monthly payments at 15 percent of your discretionary income (which can be as small as zero); choosing the right repayment program, which will often be IBR, is key to maximizing the program’s benefits.
</p>
<p>
    3. Once you’ve made 120 payments that meet these requirements—they can be non-consecutive—you can then apply for forgiveness: cancellation of the entire remaining loan balance, tax-free.
</p>
<p>
    In other words, 10 years of public work and qualifying payments mean that the thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of dollars hanging over your head like Damocles’ sword will disappear, once and for all. Considering that many jobs in the public sector require graduate degrees, the effects could be enormous. PSLF might even help to defuse the time bomb of national student debt, which now totals more than $1.3 trillion.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span class="ledein">But in practice, every step of PSLF’s process</span> has been extremely confusing—not least because the federal government planned none of them in advance. Many of the required provisions of the program did not exist until years after it was technically underway. Two of the qualifying repayment plans for PSLF—IBR and Pay As You Earn (PAYE)—took effect in 2009 and 2012, respectively. No “Dear Borrower” letter laying out the specifications of the program existed until 2011. Borrowers could not find out if their employment formally qualified and what counted as full time, as part time, or as a proper nonprofit—and therefore, how many qualifying payments they had made—until 2012, when the employment certification form was first introduced.
</p>
<p>
    Angela Mrozinski, who has been making payments toward forgiveness for four years, has found the touch-and-go development of such an extensive program
    disconcerting. “It seemed so odd to me that they have this large program, but they are trying to formalize it as they go,” she said.
</p>
<p>
    Student loan lawyers and advocates (many of them borrowers themselves) say that the opaque process, and lack of assistance offered, leads some people to give up. “They don’t make it easy,” said Claire Crowley, a student loan lawyer. “Which is also one of the reasons that people go into default.”
</p>
<p>
    In 2011, Schenkkan consolidated her federal loans, chose a payment plan, and began making payments toward forgiveness. But in spring 2012, she received a letter informing her that she had made zero qualifying payments, despite the fact that she had been paying for more than 12 months. After many phone calls, she discovered she was on the wrong version of the standard repayment plan: The standard 10-year repayment plan qualified for PSLF, but her 25-year repayment plan, then also called a standard plan, didn’t, despite the fact that there would be nothing left to forgive at the end of a 10-year repayment plan. The Department of Education’s website at the time did not clarify this distinction, she said.
</p>
<p>
    Schenkkan is hardly the only borrower to have missed this difference. Her friend Neal Spinler, who thought he had been paying toward PSLF for two years, made the same error. Many others have made months, sometimes years, of payments only to discover that none of them qualified.
</p>
<p>
    Their experience drives home what longtime student loan lawyer and advocate Heather Jarvis calls the “convoluted complexity” of the entire system. Schenkkan previously worked as a grant writer and considers herself financially literate, but as Jarvis explained, “It doesn’t matter how long you spend on your research and how sophisticated you are because it’s incredibly hard to navigate even when you have accurate information.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span class="ledein">In the decade-plus journey toward forgiveness,</span> borrowers have no way of knowing whether their applications will be accepted. Adding to this uncertainty: The last and most important step of the program is still under construction. The application form for forgiveness does not yet exist. The Department of Education has stated that forms will be available closer to the first eligible date, in 2017.
</p>
<p>
    Spinler didn’t think he would finish paying off his student loans before he was 60, but if all goes according to plan, even in spite of his two lost years, he will qualify for forgiveness in 2022, when he’s 47. Assuming that a quarter of the roughly four million borrowers on a qualifying plan who stand to benefit from the program are public servants, about a million people like Spinler potentially qualify for the program each year. But exact numbers on program participants are impossible to find—because they don’t exist.
</p>
<p>
    That’s because the program isn’t quite a program yet. Even when borrowers obtain correct information about PSLF and take steps to become eligible, they are technically not accepted into the program until after they have made all 120 qualifying payments and applied. This means that the earliest anyone would be eligible to actually enter the forgiveness program is 2017. The Department of Education has no way of keeping count because borrowers may not have voluntarily submitted their most recent employment certification forms. According to a Department of Education spokesperson, nearly 360,000 unique employer certification forms have been submitted as of May 2015. There is no strict requirement that borrowers complete any of the forms until they apply for forgiveness, at which point they are expected to assemble a decade’s worth of documentation as proof.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span class="ledein">The stakes are high</span>—and not just for the government. Mrozinski, Schenkkan, and Spinler, among many others, report experiencing doubt, uncertainty, and
    severe stress throughout the process. Each discussed how the requirements of the PSLF program, along with the usual burden of student loans, affected their search for jobs, working schedules, and family planning.
</p>
<p>
    “You have to make very important decisions that have far-reaching financial implications to take advantage of the benefits,” said Jarvis, “like considering whether to postpone and delay children.” Jarvis added that the stress borrowers feel is understandable. “They’re pioneers in the program, and they don’t have any history, experience, or precedent to rely upon.”
</p>
<p>
    Borrowers are concerned about President Obama’s twice-floated budget proposal to cap the amount forgiven by the program at $57,000, which would limit the program’s benefits for those who need them most. More than one in four public defenders surveyed by the National Legal Aid and Defender Association have in excess of $175,000 in student loan debt, and over half said they would leave the public sector if the program were capped. Legislators have also toyed with the idea of eliminating the program entirely, but all four student loan lawyers interviewed stated that a total termination of the program is not only extremely unlikely but would also not affect those who’ve already taken out loans.
</p>
<p>
    But the program’s “all-or-nothing” benefits are perhaps the most terrifying part. “If it all works out, my loans will be forgiven, and it will be amazing, and I’m really sort of counting on that,” Mrozinski said. “But once people hit this 10-year mark and the government starts to forgive these loans, where is this money going to come from? Are they actually going to support it once they put their money where their mouth is?
</p>
<p>
    “If what I’m doing doesn’t qualify for forgiveness,” she added, “then I’m screwing myself right now.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <span class="ledein">Any reform to PSLF has the potential for huge effects</span> — for better or for worse. What’s clear is that for the program to be as powerful as it intends, more transparency and simplicity is needed. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) estimates that about one in four workers in the United States
    qualifies for PSLF, but it’s unknown how many qualify yet fail to take advantage of the program. The complexity of program requirements and confusion of program options, the CFPB stated, may act as a “deterrent for borrowers weighing a career in public service.” Jarvis says that the program’s benefits are not as effective as they could be had the program been “simplified and easier to access.”
</p>
<p>
    The Student Aid Bill of Rights, to be implemented within the next year, should streamline some aspects of the process for borrowers. There have been some efforts on the part of the Department of Education to promote the program’s existence to the millions who might be eligible: a revised website, the ntroduction of necessary forms, and a more simplified and streamlined presentation of the necessary information. According to a Department of Education spokesperson, the Federal Student Aid office, which oversees PSLF, will be planning its first direct outreach campaign about the program to borrowers later in 2015. To help employers provide information about loan forgiveness programs to their employees, the CFPB issued a toolkit and asked public service employers to contact them to take a “Public Service Pledge.”
</p>
<p>
    But student advocates, including Jarvis, have said that until the government and contracted loan servicers are also mandated to provide their clients with full information about available programs, and until outreach efforts become formalized, PSLF’s crucial benefits will remain unsung. In the coming months, the CFPB will release the results of its investigation of servicers failing to provide information or providing misleading information.
</p>
<p>
    For now, the program’s potential beneficiaries can only hope. Schenkkan always educates the intern program she runs all about PSLF and how exciting it is. “But a part of me is worried that it will go away,” she said. “It still seems too good to be true.” If all goes to plan, billions of dollars in student loans will annually disappear. It’s no rolling jubilee, but it’s a giant leap for studentkind.

			<p>He responded calmly and matter-of-factly about our upside-down finances without once meeting my gaze. My family lived comfortably but leanly in a mold and ant infested ranch-style house on the outskirts of Riverside, California, and I had believed in our middle-class illusion, despite watching my father cobble together an income as a used car salesman, college adjunct, and proprietor of several slowly declining businesses.
</p>
<p>
    Love felt carefully budgeted, and so I worked hard to earn my father’s affection and approval. As an 8-year-old, I took on many tasks without pay: I made small talk with customers, processed phone orders, packaged power supplies for shipping, and typed letters and invoices. My parents were my models for labor, and from them I learned a deep work ethic, as well as a blurring of the boundaries between work and home life. They spent the ’80s and early ’90s jumping from one business to another: gift retail, leather imports, security alarms, and computer parts. When Commodore computers lost their market appeal, my parents embarked on farming shiitake mushrooms. I can still remember them coming home in the early morning hours covered in mud from picking. But despite my family’s financial instability, my life seemed carefree compared to my father’s childhood in post-war Taiwan, which was overshadowed by poverty,
    starvation, and constant military occupation.
</p>
<p>
    I left home for college at the age of 17, knowing I’d need to find my own way. Armed with a handful of scholarships that ran out during my junior year, I eventually borrowed more than $50,000 to complete my liberal arts undergraduate education, pursue my fantasy of becoming a writer at the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics, and continue my journey in art school. The burden of going so deeply into debt in my 20s stunted me. I had slowly paid it off by my late 30s, but I had spent nearly 15 years in a constant state of paralysis about my finances. My daily anxieties ranged from whether I could pay rent to whether I could afford bus fare or gas, or put a postage stamp on a letter.
</p>
<p>
    Years have gone by, and now that my partner and I have recently decided to buy our first home, I’ve realized the necessity of more deeply understanding my feelings toward obligation. Why, when it comes down to it, would I feel better about owing $450,000 to Fannie Mae than accepting the down payment offered by my parents?
</p>
<p>
    The debt that I owe them is insurmountable and something that my father never ceases to remind me of. He cast off his culture, family, and identity to immigrate. His unshakable belief that human beings enter this world owing everything—their possessions, their karma, their lives—to their ancestors perpetuates a Confucian system of debt bondage that has haunted his entire life and pervaded mine. Like my father, who is indebted to his parents and the ancestors who first brought his family from China to Taiwan, I inherited a debt that can never be repaid: the debt of being born, and of choosing a life different from the one my parents wished for me.
</p>
<p>
    When I married, I paid a small fraction of what I owed to my parents, and again when I gave my father a grandson, who will continue the family line. And yet the debt to my family continues to accrue, leading me to deep confusion about the worth of my work and the essential value of my life as a human being.
</p>
<p>
    Despite that pain, I’ve been curious and eager to rethink it all. In my late 20s, I met a holistic healer and teacher through my literary community in Dallas. Dr. Gregg embodied abundance and the very opposite of the tallying of accounts and favors. He didn’t operate from a fundamental position of scarcity but lived a life overflowing with richness. I watched him mentor and influence my partner as a holistic practitioner, as well as empower many others to break through their own pain and discomfort to find healing. And even today, Dr. Gregg remains my on-call go-to person for questions related to my son’s health. He has never ceased to give his energy freely, in a way that has confirmed to me that the exchange between human beings is one that might be based not in economic imperatives—but in the act of love.
</p>
<p>
    Through uncoupling my feelings about financial debt from the burden of family obligation, it becomes possible to imagine another life—one in which debt, along with its sibling, guilt, has lost its energetic potency and has been left to be buried with my ancestors. I try to picture interactions with my family that are free of duty and expectation, and I feel reassured knowing that this disquiet won’t be passed on to my son, Tomo, as he owes me nothing.

    		<p>In the lead-up to the 150th anniversary, both Northwestern University and the University of Denver issued detailed reports on Sand Creek. Those investigations were inspired by the demands of students and community members that the universities examine the role of John Evans, Colorado&rsquo;s second governor. Evans helped found Northwestern before moving to Colorado, where he subsequently founded the University of Denver.</p> 
    		<p>Evans had ordered the recruitment of his territory&rsquo;s volunteer militia and had fanned the flames of racial hatred in the region beforehand. A Methodist doctor from Illinois, Evans became territorial governor shortly after the election of his close friend Abraham Lincoln, whose administration worked to expand the Republican Party&rsquo;s influence in the West. Evans had hoped to bring the Colorado Territory into the Union as a free state, and the University of Denver became one of the first universities established in the West. His name figures prominently across each institution as well as their respective metropolitan areas. Northwestern has the John Evans Alumni Center. Endowed professorships carry his name. Evanston, Illinois, home of Northwestern, as well as Colorado&rsquo;s Mt. Evans are named after him.</p> 
    		<p>Both universities lack Native American Studies programs, which may partly explain why they were so unprepared for student and community concerns. Neither institution had ever recognized Evans&rsquo; involvement with the massacre. University leaders were unaware of their founder&rsquo;s ties to Native American massacre and dispossession, and few American Indian history or studies courses have ever been offered at either school.</p>

    		<p>The National Park Service has declared the massacre site a National Historic Site, and tribal members from across the West have long participated in annual commemorative runs to honor and remember those lost. As the state of Colorado formed the Colorado Sand Creek Massacre Commemorative Commission, students, faculty, alumni, and community members asked how their universities could not know about, let alone acknowledge, their founder’s connections to such potentially genocidal actions?</p> 
    		<p>The appalling actions of the past appeared mirrored in the present by the shocking underrepresentation of Native American students, staff, and faculty on both campuses. Native American students and faculty comprise less than one-half of 1 percent of the Northwestern campus community, although Chicago is home to tens of thousands of tribal members. Both Chicago and Denver have decades-old Indian communities and have attracted Native people for generations. Each served as a major urban relocation center for government programs that subsidized the one-way migration of reservation community members to urban areas as part of the U.S. Termination policy. Prominent community centers, pan-Indian associations, and annual powwows, including the Denver March Powwow, are located in each.</p> 
            <p>In response to the protests, administrators on both campuses established review committees that exposed the deep moral culpability of Evans&rsquo; actions. While he was out of the state at the time of the massacre, Evans had both authorized and encouraged settlers to &ldquo;kill and destroy&rdquo; Plains Indian communities, had pleaded for increased military units, and, as the region&rsquo;s foremost state leader, had fatefully informed Cheyenne leaders that retribution for summer raids was forthcoming. A subsequent committee at Northwestern attempted to outline institutional remedies aimed at commemorating the victims of the massacre. In addition, each university committed to increase recruitment, retention, and advancement of Native students and faculty. These processes continue, as do discussions about how best to commemorate the Sand Creek atrocities. Inviting prominent speakers, suggested freshman common readings, and preliminary commitments to build centers for Native American Studies characterize such efforts. The institutional commitment needed to maintain these undertakings, however, is unclear.</p> 
    		<p>Nationally, Indian students and community members have worked to commemorate the legacies of the massacre as well as to recognize the larger history of atrocities against Native peoples. Throughout November, Native American community members held vigils and observed moments of silence to commemorate these atrocities. Such events, social media campaigns, newspaper editorials, and related activism brought heightened attention to the subject. On December 10, 2014, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the Chicago City Council passed a resolution recognizing the city&rsquo;s place in the massacre, sending notice to the board of trustees at each campus. The resolution drew upon both universities&rsquo; committee reports, as well as historic coverage from the Chicago Tribune which noted 150 years ago the acts of “hideous cruelty” that occurred during the massacre. Acknowledging as well the &ldquo;genocidal mission&rdquo; of Chivington, the resolution states, &ldquo;we, the Mayor, and members of the Chicago City Council &hellip; do hereby reflect upon that day of sorrow and extend our deepest regrets and sympathies to the descendants of the men, women, and children slain at Sand Creek.&rdquo;</p>
    		<p>Such efforts of commemoration begin a process of acknowledgement and recognition, but are by themselves insufficient for a full reckoning of the legacies of U.S. state violence against Indian communities. Sand Creek is seared into the cultural heritage of Cheyenne and Arapaho communities and into the regional as well as institutional identities of these universities. While astonishing, the historical amnesia surrounding the racial hatred and violent practices of U.S. leaders remains comparatively insignificant in the face of the incalculable losses of life, land, and possibilities on that fateful day.</p>

			<p>In a span of just three weeks this spring, a police officer in South Carolina, a reserve deputy in Oklahoma, and a veteran police officer in Pennsylvania were charged with criminal homicide in the deaths of unarmed suspects.</p> 
			<p>These events take their place on a growing list of controversial police killings that have focused national attention on the need to bring law enforcement back to its original mission: &ldquo;protect and serve.&rdquo; To this end, no fewer than three national bodies&mdash;the President&rsquo;s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and the Department of Justice (DOJ)&mdash;have issued reports this year calling for expanded investments in so-called community policing.</p>
			<p>Community-oriented policing is not a new concept, nor has it lacked strong federal advocacy since the DOJ adopted it as a formal strategy in 1994. To date, the DOJ&rsquo;s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) has distributed more than $14 billion in grants to thousands of law enforcement agencies to advance a broad range of strategies ostensibly organized around community policing principles.</p> 
			<p>While many of these initiatives have borne fruit, the program has challenges. Since community policing is more a philosophy than a standardized set of practices, departments have a lot of flexibility in how the term gets translated on the street. And they don&rsquo;t always get it right.</p> 
			<p>Still, it&rsquo;s hard to find a police department today that doesn&rsquo;t at least pay lip service to the ideals of community policing. A few stand out as notable success stories; however, even among successful agencies, many have learned the hard way that community policing is not an end in itself, but an ongoing process that requires regular fine-tuning.</p>

<!-- ======================= COPY ======================= -->        
			<p class="spaceabove">Community policing operates on the core principle that citizens are most likely to respond positively to law enforcement efforts that mesh with their own concerns—in other words, something that is being done for them, rather than done to them. The philosophy is grounded in the belief that an emphasis on procedural justice and responsive problem solving leads to improved public perceptions of the police, and that leads more generally to better law enforcement outcomes. The agencies that get it right invariably share one thing in common: progressive leaders who are committed to thinking outside the box.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;Nobody changes the police from the outside,&rdquo; says David C. Couper, who spent 21 years as the chief of police in Madison, Wisconsin, a college city of just under 250,000 people. &ldquo;The only people that can change the police are police themselves and their leaders, and absent that, not much is going to happen.&rdquo;</p> 
			<p>Couper was an early pioneer of decentralized policing, and by the mid-1980s had used his tenured leadership post to transform the core mission of his department. On his watch, the department walked back an emphasis on code enforcement and started dedicating officers long-term to specific neighborhoods, giving them the discretion to work with community members to choose which crimes to prioritize. At one point, he says, the result was the de facto decriminalization of possession of small amounts of marijuana.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;Community policing is about how officers define themselves,&rdquo; says Couper. &ldquo;If police see themselves solely as law enforcement officers, then they&rsquo;ll spend all their time looking for some broken laws to enforce.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Madison&rsquo;s community policing strategy was expanded and formalized after Couper&rsquo;s departure, largely under the tenure of his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, Noble Wray, who led the Madison Police Department (MPD) from 2004–2013. A survey of community partners conducted in the months before Wray&rsquo;s departure showed an above-average level of trust in law enforcement and a high degree of two-way interaction between police and citizens.</p>

			<p>By all accounts, Madison stands as one of the nation’s community policing success stories. But it also serves as a warning against the dangers of complacency. The city’s decision in December 2012 not to file charges against a Madison police officer with a history of recklessness who shot an unarmed drunk man angered many in the community.</p> 
			<p>According to Sue Williams, Madison’s assistant chief of police, the department has been taking proactive steps to repair the rift. She says Madison’s new chief, Michael C. Koval, meets regularly with a Community Advisory Council, and the department has a “living” document outlining its trust-building initiatives posted on its website that is updated four times a year in response to community feedback. This year, the city began deploying an officer in each of its five districts who is trained to handle interactions with the mentally ill.</p> 
			<p>Nevertheless, the MPD faced yet another setback in March when the fatal police shooting of an unarmed 19-year-old biracial man named Tony Robinson put Madison in the national spotlight and sparked a series of #BlackLivesMatter protests in the city. As of this writing, the district attorney had yet to decide if charges would be filed against the officer, a 12-year veteran of the force with a checkered history.</p> 
			<p>Williams says the crisis offers an opportunity for the department to prove its commitment to community policing.</p> 
			<p>“We need to be out in our community, engaging with citizens, actively breaking down those barriers some are trying to build,” Williams says. “We have to be open and accessible.”</p>

			<p class="spaceabove">To Lieutenant Tim Schmidt, a district commander in Anaheim, California—another early adopter of community policing—Madison’s experience underscores the provisional nature of community policing programs.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;Community policing is not a destination, it&rsquo;s a process you have to keep working each day,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the journey of problem solving.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>Anaheim launched a limited community policing pilot in 1995 that emphasized code enforcement and crisis intervention over long-term relationship building. The city has seen its COPS efforts evolve over the years and continues to refine them.</p> 
			<p>Anaheim is a larger, more ethnically diverse city than Madison. Since 1980, the percentage of residents of Latino heritage has grown from 17 percent to 53 percent. The changing demographics have challenged the Anaheim Police Department (APD) to reinvent its community policing program over the years with an eye toward improving community engagement.</p> 
			<p>A 2009 report commissioned by the DOJ found that the APD&rsquo;s community policing efforts, combined with a citywide effort to facilitate community governance, had succeeded in fostering improved levels of neighborhood leadership and sustainability.</p> 
			<p>In the wake of violent protests in 2012 incited by a pair of controversial police shootings, the department doubled down on its community policing effort. The APD hired 13 new officers and assigned them to community policing &ldquo;teams&rdquo; that concentrate on proactive relationship building instead of responding to calls.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not talking about a guy just getting out of his car and just talking to people,&rdquo; says Schmidt. &ldquo;It has to be constant two-way interaction, and that feedback needs to find its way back to our regular patrol officers.&rdquo;</p>
			<p>In 2013 Anaheim hired its first Latino police chief, Raul Quezada, who promised to prioritize civic engagement. He started by establishing a program called &ldquo;Coffee with a Cop,&rdquo; designed to facilitate informal police-community interaction, and says he is committed to seeking civilian input on important issues.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;The key is listening to the community to determine what their problems are instead of having us tell them what their problems are,&rdquo; said Quezada, in an interview with an Orange County policing blog in 2014.</p>

			<p class="spaceabove">Gauging whether a community policing program has been successful ultimately depends on how you define success. For the DOJ, community policing sits at the nexus of three primary elements: &ldquo;organizational transformation,&rdquo; &ldquo;community partnerships,&rdquo; and &ldquo;problem solving.&rdquo; But federal auditors, as well as many police agencies themselves, tend to overemphasize the latter of these variables, which, in practice, frequently gets simplified into &ldquo;crime solving&rdquo; at street level. That&rsquo;s probably because it&rsquo;s the easiest metric to track.</p> 
			<p>In Schmidt&rsquo;s view, for instance, community policing is primarily a crime-fighting strategy that has the added benefit of building good will with residents. When asked for examples of community policing in action, he tends to cite standard law enforcement metrics like reductions in call volume and drops in nuisance crime. For Couper, and many other early community-oriented policing pioneers we spoke to, community policing begins with officer discretion and civic engagement and ends in increased public safety.</p> 
			<p>While the difference between these two approaches may seem like one of semantics, in practice they often manifest in contradictory policing strategies. There are lots of ways to solve the problem of crime, and not all of them facilitate healthy police-community relations. As the nation faces the crisis of a breakdown in community trust for law enforcement, departments will face more pressure to measure their community policing programs against something other than crime data.</p> 
			<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about satisfaction and trust&mdash;that&rsquo;s the first place we should be looking,&rdquo; says Charlotte Gill, a community policing researcher at George Mason University.</p> 
			<p>The COPS office has already begun this evolution. Since the launch of its Collaborative Reform Initiative for Technical Assistance in 2011, the DOJ has been gradually realigning its mission to prioritize trust-building initiatives.</p> 
			<p>Ronald Davis, the current COPS director, calls this a critical component of effective community policing.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Earning the trust of the community and making those individuals stakeholders in their own safety enables law enforcement to better understand and address both the needs of the community and the factors that contribute to crime.&rdquo;</p>

            		<p class="byline editorsnote">Little Bear&rsquo;s story at the Sand Creek Massacre represents a unique firsthand account of the massacre. George Bent translated and penned his story around 1906 and mailed it to author and historian George Hyde.</p>
            		<p>I looked towards Fort Lyon Trail south of the village when I seen long black line. Then I knew soldiers were coming to attack the village.</p>
            		<p>I found my war bonnet, shield and my quiver full of arrows&hellip; While I was putting on my war bonnet and shield, bullets were hitting all around me and bullets were hitting the lodges like hard storm… On way up [Sand Creek] the feathers of my war bonnet were shot away and my shield was shot several times, but I did not get hit.</p>
            		<p>When I got to the bank of the creek I seen Big Head, Crow Neck, Cut Lip Bear, and Smoker, standing behind the bank so I joined them&hellip; We were west end of the village&hellip; Big Head and his party&hellip; ran west. I turned and went north as I seen big crowd [of Cheyenne] going that way. About 20 soldiers followed me. Big Head and his party were all killed over the hill&hellip;</p>
            		<p>I seen lots of women and children that had been killed. Some were not dead yet&hellip; After the fight was over I seen 2 or 3 soldiers together standing over the dead I suppose scalping them.</p>
